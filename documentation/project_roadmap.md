## Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering

*Objective: Define the scope, core features, and technical requirements of the application.*

   1. Define Core Features
      - Identify essential features: user account management, CV creation, template selection, CV export (PDF download), and profile management.

   2. Architectural Design and Technology Stack
      - Decide on the architecture (e.g., Spring Boot for backend, Angular for frontend).
      - Select supporting technologies, such as Keycloak for authentication, PostgreSQL or MySQL for the database, and libraries for PDF generation.
      - Create a high-level system architecture diagram showing the interactions between components (frontend, backend, database, and third-party services).

   3. Database Design
      - Design the database schema with tables for users, CVs, templates, and related sections.
      - Ensure the schema supports many-to-one or one-to-many relationships where needed (e.g., users to CVs, CVs to templates).

## Phase 2: Setting Up the Development Environment

*Objective: Create a foundation for development and set up a scalable project structure.*

   1. Initialize the Spring Boot Backend
      - Set up a basic Spring Boot project with dependencies like Spring Data JPA for database interaction, Spring Security for authorization, and REST controllers.
      - Configure the database connection, ensuring it’s ready to store user, CV, and template data.

   2. Initialize the Angular Frontend
      - Set up an Angular project with routing and component structure, and configure HTTP client modules for backend API communication.
      - Create a modular structure to ensure separation between features (e.g., modules for user, CV, and template functionalities).

   3. Set Up Authentication (Keycloak)
      - Configure Keycloak as the identity provider, integrating it with the Spring Boot backend.
      - Enable frontend OAuth2 flow for user login and roles, ensuring users can only access their own data.

## Phase 3: Backend Development – Core Features

*Objective: Build and expose the API endpoints required for core CV functionality.*

   1. Create Models and Entities
      - Implement Java classes and database entities for main components, like User, CV, Template, and CV sections (work experience, skills, etc.).
      - Set up relationships and constraints to maintain data integrity.

   2. CRUD Operations for CVs and Templates
      - Create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for CVs and templates, enabling users to create, retrieve, update, and delete their CVs.
      - Add validation to ensure data consistency.

   3. CV Generation Logic
      - Develop services to assemble user profile data and populate a selected template structure.
      - Prepare endpoints for retrieving template previews and generating the final CV output.

   4. Testing and Documentation
      - Implement unit and integration tests for key backend functionality.
      - Document the API using Swagger or OpenAPI to assist frontend integration.

## Phase 4: Frontend Development – Core Features

*Objective: Build and connect frontend interfaces to backend services, focusing on user experience for CV creation and preview.*

   1. User Registration and Profile Management
      - Develop pages for user registration, login, and profile management.
      - Ensure that user authentication status is managed properly using Keycloak integration.

   2. CV Creation and Editing Interface
      - Build forms for users to enter data for each section of their CV, such as personal information, work experience, education, and skills.
      - Use Angular Reactive Forms to manage form state and validation for a smooth experience.

   3. Template Selection and Preview
      - Create an interface where users can browse and preview available CV templates.
      - Enable users to select a template, which updates the preview in real-time as they fill out CV information.

   4. Data Binding and Real-Time Preview
      - Implement real-time binding between the data entered and the CV preview section, displaying the user’s data in the chosen template format.
      - Create components for dynamic sections like work experience or skills to allow users to add, edit, and delete entries.

## Phase 5: CV Export and PDF Generation

*Objective: Enable users to download their CV as a PDF.*

   1. Backend PDF Generation Service
      - Develop a backend service that converts the completed CV (in HTML/CSS format) to PDF using a library like iText or Apache PDFBox.
      - Create an endpoint to handle PDF generation requests, ensuring that user authentication is validated before accessing the CV download.

   2. Frontend Download Button and Request Handling
      - Add a "Download CV" button in the frontend that triggers a request to the backend for PDF generation.
      - Display download progress or success notifications to inform users of the export status.

   3. Testing PDF Generation
      - Test PDF outputs across different templates and data combinations to ensure formatting is consistent and error-free.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features and Customization

*Objective: Offer users more customization options and improve template management.*

   1. Advanced Template Management
      - Allow administrators to add, update, or remove templates.
      - Optionally, let users customize template styles like color, font, and layout adjustments.

   2. User-Defined Custom Templates (Optional)
      - Enable users to upload their HTML templates or configure custom sections and layouts.
      - Ensure validation and security checks on user-uploaded templates to prevent malicious code.

---

## Phase 7: Testing, Optimization, and Finalization

*Objective: Ensure application reliability, security, and performance.*

   1. Comprehensive Testing
      - Conduct end-to-end (E2E) testing to verify the complete user journey from account creation to CV download.
      - Perform unit, integration, and load testing on both frontend and backend components.

   2. Performance and Security Optimization
      - Review database indexing and query performance to optimize data retrieval.
      - Conduct a security audit of user data access, API endpoints, and PDF generation.

   3. UI/UX Refinements
      - Gather feedback from test users to identify improvements for the UI/UX.
      - Make final adjustments to enhance usability and accessibility.

---

## Phase 8: Deployment and Monitoring

*Objective: Deploy the application and set up monitoring for ongoing maintenance.*

   1. Set Up Deployment Infrastructure
      - Use Docker or similar containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
      - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment, testing, and updates.

   2. Monitoring and Logging
      - Implement monitoring and logging solutions like Grafana, Prometheus, or ELK Stack to track application health.
      - Set up error tracking to catch and handle issues in real-time.
