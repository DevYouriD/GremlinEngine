# Architectural or high level decisions
This file describes the architectural decisions we made during the development of the application.

## Backend and frontend frameworks (Spring Boot / AngularJS)


## Database (SQL / NoSql)


## Identity and access management (login and privileges)


## Generating the PDFs in the front or back-end.
Placing CV generation in the backend is often preferred due to better control over formatting, 
enhanced data privacy, and more consistent performance. Backend generation also supports 
complex layouts and error handling, which can be challenging for frontend libraries.
